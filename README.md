Speed Typing Test using Python-tkinter
Here's a GitHub README for the Typing Speed Test code:

# Typing Speed Test

This is a Python script that creates a GUI-based typing speed test game using the tkinter module. The game has a timer, and the player must type a given word correctly and press enter to move to the next word before the time runs out. 

## Getting Started

To run the script, you will need Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

You will also need to install the tkinter module, which is usually included with Python. If you don't have it, you can install it by running the following command:

```
pip install tk
```

Once you have Python and tkinter installed, you can run the script by navigating to the directory where it is saved and running the following command:

```
python typing_speed_test.py
```

## How to Play

1. Press the "Enter" key to start the game.
2. A word will appear in the "Word" section of the window. Type the word in the "Input" section as quickly and accurately as you can.
3. Press the "Enter" key to submit your answer. If your answer is correct, a new word will appear and your score will increase by one.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the time runs out.
5. When the time runs out, your final score will be displayed in the "Count" section of the window.

## Customization

You can customize the game by changing the following variables in the script:

- `seconds`: The number of seconds the game will last.
- `word_list`: The list of words that the game will choose from. You can add or remove words from this list to change the difficulty of the game.
- `FONT_NAME`, `RED`, `BLUE`, and `BLACK`: The font and color settings for the text in the window.
